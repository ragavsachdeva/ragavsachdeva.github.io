      abstract={We live in a dynamic world where things change all the time. Given two images of the same scene, being able to automatically detect the changes in them has practical applications in a variety of domains. In this paper, we tackle the change detection problem with the goal of detecting "object-level" changes in an image pair despite differences in their viewpoint and illumination. To this end, we make the following four contributions: (i) we propose a scalable methodology for obtaining a large-scale change detection training dataset by leveraging existing object segmentation benchmarks; (ii) we introduce a co-attention based novel architecture that is able to implicitly determine correspondences between an image pair and find changes in the form of bounding box predictions; (iii) we contribute four evaluation datasets that cover a variety of domains and transformations, including synthetic image changes, real surveillance images of a 3D scene, and synthetic 3D scenes with camera motion; (iv) we evaluate our model on these four datasets and demonstrate zero-shot and beyond training transformation generalization.}

      abstract = {We propose a new training algorithm, ScanMix, that explores semantic clustering and semi-supervised learning (SSL) to allow superior robustness to severe label noise and competitive robustness to non-severe label noise problems, in comparison to the state of the art (SOTA) methods. ScanMix is based on the expectation maximisation framework, where the E-step estimates the latent variable to cluster the training images based on their appearance and classification results, and the M-step optimises the SSL classification and learns effective feature representations via semantic clustering. We present a theoretical result that shows the correctness and convergence of ScanMix, and an empirical result that shows that ScanMix has SOTA results on CIFAR-10/-100 (with symmetric, asymmetric and semantic label noise), Red Mini-ImageNet (from the Controlled Noisy Web Labels), Clothing1M and WebVision. In all benchmarks with severe label noise, our results are competitive to the current SOTA.}

      abstract = {State-of-the-art noisy-label learning algorithms rely on an unsupervised learning to classify training samples as clean or noisy, followed by a semi-supervised learning (SSL) that minimises the empirical vicinal risk using a labelled set formed by samples classified as clean, and an unlabelled set with samples classified as noisy. The classification accuracy of such noisy-label learning methods depends on the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples, and the robustness of SSL to small clean sets. We address these points with a new noisy-label training algorithm, called LongReMix, which improves the precision of the unsupervised classification of clean and noisy samples and the robustness of SSL to small clean sets with a two-stage learning process. The stage one of LongReMix finds a small but precise high-confidence clean set, and stage two augments this high-confidence clean set with new clean samples and oversamples the clean data to increase the robustness of SSL to small clean sets. We test LongReMix on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with introduced synthetic noisy labels, and the real-world noisy-label benchmarks CNWL (Red Mini-ImageNet), WebVision, Clothing1M, and Food101-N. The results show that our LongReMix produces significantly better classification accuracy than competing approaches, particularly in high noise rate problems. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in most datasets.},

The difficulty of maintaining a human workforce on the Moon and communications lag with Earth means that mining will need to be conducted using collaborative robots with a high degree of autonomy. In this paper, we describe our solution for Phase 2 of the NASA Space Robotics Challenge, which provided a simulated lunar environment in which teams were tasked to develop software systems to achieve autonomous collaborative robots for mining on the Moon. Our 3rd place and innovation award winning solution shows how machine learning-enabled vision could alleviate major challenges posed by the lunar environment towards autonomous space mining, chiefly the lack of satellite positioning systems, hazardous terrain, and delicate robot interactions. A robust multi-robot coordinator was also developed to achieve long-term operation and effective collaboration between robots.}

      abstract = {The efficacy of deep learning depends on large-scale data sets that have been carefully curated with reliable data acquisition and annotation processes. However, acquiring such large-scale data sets with precise annotations is very expensive and time-consuming, and the cheap alternatives often yield data sets that have noisy labels. The field has addressed this problem by focusing on training models under two types of label noise: 1) closed-set noise, where some training samples are incorrectly annotated to a training label other than their known true class; and 2) open-set noise, where the training set includes samples that possess a true class that is (strictly) not contained in the set of known training labels. In this work, we study a new variant of the noisy label problem that combines the open-set and closed-set noisy labels, and introduce a benchmark evaluation to assess the performance of training algorithms under this setup. We argue that such problem is more general and better reflects the noisy label scenarios in practice. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm, called EvidentialMix, that addresses this problem and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art methods for both closed-set and open-set noise on the proposed benchmark. Our results show that our method produces superior classification results and better feature representations than previous state-of-the-art methods.}
