Deep learning has achieved impressive results on problems that seemed insurmountable, if not impossible, not too long ago. Its growing applications in areas ranging from computer vision and natural language processing to bio-informatics and medical imaging has made it a very captivating tool for industry and academics alike. However, much of the recent success of deep learning is largely attributed to supervised learning, where the efficacy of models depends on the availability of large-scale datasets with clean and reliable labels. Acquiring such large-scale datasets is typically very expensive and time-consuming and the cheap alternatives often result in datasets that have noisy labels. Consequently, one of the important challenges of the field is the development of methods that can cope with such noisy datasets.
