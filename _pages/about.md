Hi! I am an incoming PhD student in the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}. I did my undergraduate degree in computer science at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/){:target="\_blank"}, where I worked with [Prof. Gustavo Carneiro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E0TtOWAAAAAJ){:target="\_blank"} (supervisor) and [Prof. Ian Reid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ATkNLcQAAAAJ){:target="\_blank"} (advisor) on the 'Learning with Noisy Labels' problem. I am also a former SWE intern at Google and Microsoft.
