Hi! I am a second year PhD student in the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/){:target="\_blank"} at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, supervised by [Prof. Andrew Zisserman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=UZ5wscMAAAAJ){:target="\_blank"}. I did my undergraduate degree in computer science at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/){:target="\_blank"}, where I did my honours thesis with [Prof. Gustavo Carneiro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E0TtOWAAAAAJ){:target="\_blank"}, and worked at Google and Microsoft as a SWE intern. My CV (updated Mar 2022) is available [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
